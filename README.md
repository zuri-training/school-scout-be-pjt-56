The stacks used for the project backend include:

| <b><u>Stack</u></b> | <b><u>Usage</u></b> |
| :---         | :---         |
| **`Python 3.9`** | Programming language. |
| **`Django`** | General backend |
| **`DBML`** | Datamodels |
| **` Django Rest framework`** | APIs. |
| **`Django Rest Auth`** | Authentication. |
| **`PostgreSql`** | Database. |

#
> ## Backend Team To-do list

- Create the data models.

- API Setup.

- Database and repo setup.

- User testing.

- Authentication controls.

- Documentation of the backend process.

- Troubleshoot and debug the project.

- Integrate a live chat feature. 

#
> ## Backend Repo Setup

To setup the repo, First fork and clone the Zuriteam Team 56 backend repository to create a copy on the local machine. 

```bash
# git clone git@github.com:pauline-banye/school-scout-be-pjt-56.git
```
Change directory to the cloned repo and set the original Zuriteam Team 56 backend repository as the "upstream" and the forked Zuriteam Team 56 backend repository as the "origin" using gitbash.

```bash
# git remote add upstream git@github.com:zuri-training/school-scout-be-pjt-56.git
```
Edit the read.me file and add it to git to track changes. Create the first commit using the `git commit -m "updated readme.md"` command.

```bash
$ git commit -m "updated readme.md"
[main a4c9702] updated readme.md
1 file changed, 197 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
rewrite README.md (100%)
```

Using `git push origin main`, push the commit to the remote origin repository (the forked Zuriteam Team 56 backend repository). 

Finally, initiate a pull request to push the edits to the upstream repository. 

#
> ## Setting up the project'

First step requires the download and installation of Python 3.9 and a check to confirm that `pip` and the necessary dependencies are properly installed. 

After the installation of the Python program, setup the project environment with pip and virtualenv in the command prompt, powershell or gitbash terminal. Virtualenv helps to create an isolated Python environment containing all the packages necessary for the project.

*Note: 
- This project was setup using the gitbash terminal.Some of the commands used do not work wih command prompt or powershell.
- If a "pip command not found error" is encountered, download get-pip.py and run `phython get-pip.py` to install it. 

```bash
# pip install virtualenv
```
Navigate to the cloned local school-scout-be-pjt-56 project folder and run `virtualenv venv` to create a virtual environment folder. 

Activate the environment by running the following command in the gitbash terminal.

```bash
source venv/scripts/activate
```

Once the virtual environment is active, the next step is the Django installation. Django is an open source Python web application framework thats helps in the rapid development of secure websites.

```bash
(venv) pip install django
```
After installing Django, install Django REST framework in the gitbash terminal. 

The Django REST framework is a flexible toolkit for building Web based APIs. The REST framework was used for the creation of APIs, serialization and the authentication process for this project.
 
```bash
(venv) pip install djangorestframework
```

#
> ## Setting up the PostgreSQL Database

Django's default database is Sqlite3 but it is quite limited, hence the decision to utilize PostgreSQL DB for this project.

To set it up and switch the database, download and install PostgreSQL interactive installer for Windows from postgresql.org/download. This installer installs the PostgreSQL database server, a terminal program called psql and pgAdmin.
