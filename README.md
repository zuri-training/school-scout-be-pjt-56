> ## Initial Backend Repo Setup

The Zuriteam Team 56 backend repository was forked and cloned to create a copy on my local machine. 

```bash
# git clone git@github.com:pauline-banye/school-scout-be-pjt-56.git
```
I changed directory to the cloned repo and set the original Zuriteam Team 56 backend repository as my "upstream" and the forked repo as the "origin".

```bash
# git remote add upstream git@github.com:zuri-training/school-scout-be-pjt-56.git
```
The next step was to create a new branch called developer `git branch developer`, and change my environment to the developer branch using `git checkout developer`.

The read.me file was edited and added to git to track changes. I created the first commit `git commit -m "updated readme.md"`.

```bash
$ git commit -m "updated readme.md"
[developer e5ab0f7] updated readme.md
 1 files changed, 179 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
 rewrite README.md (100%)
```

Using `git push origin developer`, the commit was pushed to the remote origin repository. Finally a pull request was initialized  to push my edits to the upstream repo 

#
> ## Setup

Python 3.9 was downloaded and installed. After the installation of the Python program, the project environment was setup with virtualenv and pip. 

To do this, we navigated to the local school-scout-be-pjt-56 project folder and created the 'schoolscout' project folder.

```bash
# pip install virtualenv
```
This created a virtual environment, which we activated and installed dependencies for the project.
