> ## Initial Backend Repo Setup

The Zuriteam Team 56 backend repository was forked and cloned to create a copy on my local machine. 

```bash
# git clone git@github.com:pauline-banye/school-scout-be-pjt-56.git
```
I changed directory to the cloned repo and set the original Zuriteam Team 56 backend repository as my "upstream" and the forked repo as the "origin".

```bash
# git remote add upstream git@github.com:zuri-training/school-scout-be-pjt-56.git
```
The next step  involved editing the read.me file and adding it to git to track changes. I created the first commit `git commit -m "updated readme.md"`.

```bash
$ git commit -m "updated readme.md"
[main a4c9702] updated readme.md
 1 file changed, 197 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
 rewrite README.md (100%)
```

Using `git push origin main`, the commit was pushed to the remote origin repository. Finally a pull request was initialized  to push my edits to the upstream repo 

#
> ## Setup

Python 3.9 was downloaded and installed. After the installation of the Python program, the project environment was setup with virtualenv and pip. 

To do this, we navigated to the local school-scout-be-pjt-56 project folder and installed virtualenv.

```bash
# pip install virtualenv
```
This created a virtual environment, which was activated using `virtualenv school-scout-be-pjt-56`and we checked that pip and the necessary dependencies were properly installed.

The environment was activated by running the following command in the terminal..
```bash
source school-scout-be-pjt-56/scripts/activate
```
